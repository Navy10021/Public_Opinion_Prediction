# Public_Opinion_Prediction

## 1. Project Background
  - The National Assembly of the Republic of Korea is making various efforts to detect and respond to public opinion on major social issues through opinion polls and the media.
  - However, there is a limit to the objective prediction, and considerable time and cost are incurred from preparing a solution to legislative connection. For example, in the 20th National Assembly, the approval rate of all bills was 13.2%, and the average processing time was 577.2 days.
  - Therefore, in this project, we propose a natural language processing-based artificial intelligence model that can efficiently predict online public opinion and is expected to be used as a policy decision tool in various fields.
